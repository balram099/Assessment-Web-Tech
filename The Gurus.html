      <h2><a href="Guru Nanak Dev Ji.html">Guru Nanak Dev Ji</a></h2>
      <p>Guru Nanak Dev Ji (1469-1539), the founder of Sikhism, was born into a trader family in the Punjab region, now in Pakistan. Distinguished from traditional ascetics, he was well-educated and envisioned God's presence in all aspects of life. His teachings, centred on the divine omnipresence and the importance of living a virtuous life, were compiled into the Adi Granth by the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan.</p>

      <p>Guru Angad Dev Ji, the second Sikh Guru (1504-1552), was born in Sarai Matta, India, to parents Pheru Mall Ji and Daya Kaur Ji. He married Mata Khivi, and they had four children: two sons, Dassu Ji and Dattu Ji, and two daughters, Bibi Amro Ji and Bibi Anokhi Ji. Succeeding Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, Guru Angad promoted and expanded upon his teachings. He was instrumental in developing the Gurmukhi script, a critical advancement for preserving the pronunciation of the sacred hymns of Sikhism, making them accessible to all, regardless of their linguistic background.</p>

      <p>When Angad, the second Guru of Sikhism, passed away, the mantle of leadership was entrusted to Amar Das (1479–1574), a figure revered for his unwavering devotion to his predecessor. Amar Das's journey to becoming the third Guru was unique; he was originally a Vaishnava, spending his life in search of spiritual guidance. His path took a pivotal turn during a pilgrimage to the Ganges River, where he was captivated by the hymns of Nanak, sung by Angad's daughter. This encounter inspired him to embrace Sikhism. At the age of 73, Amar Das became Guru during a period of transition for the Sikh community, which was moving beyond the initial surge of growth and enthusiasm sparked by Guru Nanak.</p>

      <p>Guru Ram Das Ji (1534–1581), the fourth Sikh Guru and son-in-law to Guru Amar Das Ji, is celebrated for founding Amritsar, the spiritual heart of Sikhism. This city, whose name means "Pool of Nectar," is home to the Harmandir Sahib, also known as the Golden Temple, the most revered temple in Sikhism. Guru Ram Das introduced significant organisational changes by appointing masands, vicar-like figures, to oversee congregations, a move from the previous system of manjis. These masands were responsible for nurturing the faith within defined congregations and regularly reported back to the Guru with updates and contributions from the community. Known for his devotion to hymn singing, Guru Ram Das Ji emphasised its importance in Sikh worship, a practice that continues to be a central aspect of Sikh spiritual life. Belonging to the Khatri caste and the Sodhi family, he appointed his son, Arjan, as his successor, establishing a line of direct descent that continued through the subsequent Gurus.</p>

      <p>Guru Arjan Dev Ji (1563–1606), the fifth Sikh Guru, faced opposition from his older brother, Prithi Chand, who disapproved of Guru Arjan Dev Ji's appointment as Guru. In an act of hostility, Prithi Chand attempted to poison Arjan's only son, Hargobind Ji. Prithi Chand and his followers spread fake hymns they claimed were from previous Gurus. To preserve the authenticity of the Sikh teachings, Guru Arjan Ji undertook the compilation of an official scripture. He enlisted Bhai Gurdas as his scribe and used the Goindval Pothis as a reference, leading to the creation of the Adi Granth. This scripture later expanded upon, evolved into the Guru Granth Sahib Ji, which remains the central religious text of Sikhism. Sikhs hold it in the highest regard, seeking its wisdom for guidance, solace, and spiritual peace. </p>

      <p>Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji (1595–1644), who led the Sikhs from 1595 to 1644 as their sixth Guru, marked a pivotal era in Sikh history by blending religious leadership with temporal, or worldly, power. This dual role was encapsulated in the concept of miri/piri (“temporal authority”/“spiritual authority”), introduced by his father, Guru Arjan, symbolising both spiritual and secular authority. Guru Hargobind Ji embodied this dual role, not only guiding his followers on a spiritual path as a pir (spiritual leader) but also acting as a mir (chieftain), ready to defend his community with force if necessary.</p>

He chose to live away from the hustle and bustle, settling in the serene Shiwalik Hills at a place called Sirmur with just a few people around him. Despite his retreat, he didn't cut himself off from his followers. Occasionally, he'd venture out to the Punjab plains to connect with and guide the Sikhs, helped by his assistants known as masands. They kept him in touch with the community, bringing news and financial support to cover the needs of the Sikh faith.</p>

      <p>Guru Hari Krishen Ji was a young and revered Sikh leader who lived a brief but impactful life from 1656 to 1664. Invited to Delhi by Emperor Aurangzeb, he sadly caught smallpox there. Facing his end, he gave a clue about who should lead the Sikhs next. His last words, "Baba Bakale," were a hint pointing to his successor. These words meant to look for the next Guru in the village of Bakala. This was his way of choosing Tegh Bahadur, a wise and respected man living in Bakala, as the next Guru. Tegh Bahadur Ji  was the son of the previous Guru, Guru Hargobind Ji, making him Guru Hari Krishen Ji’s grand-uncle.</p>

      <p>Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, the ninth Sikh Guru, lived from 1621 to 1675 and is remembered for his deep spirituality and bravery. His life took a significant turn due to a unique event. After the passing of Guru Har Krishan Ji, there was confusion about who the next Guru would be. Many people rushed to the town of Bakala, claiming they were the new Guru. A merchant named Makhan Shah, who had survived a deadly storm at sea thanks to a vow he made to the Sikh Guru, went to Bakala to fulfil his promise of 501 gold coins. To find the true Guru among many claimants, he cleverly offered only two coins to each, knowing the real Guru would know of his actual vow. When he met Tegh Bahadur Ji, the Guru immediately asked for the rest of the promised coins. Overjoyed, Makhan Shah announced Tegh Bahadur as the true Guru.</p>

He's especially celebrated for forming the Khalsa, a military fraternity of Sikhs. The son of the ninth Guru, Tegh Bahadur, who was executed by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Guru Gobind Singh was not just a spiritual guide but also a scholar and warrior. He knew several languages including Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit, aside from his native Punjabi. He played a significant role in defining Sikh laws, composed martial music and poetry, and is credited with writing the Dasam Granth Sabih Ji, an important Sikh scripture.</p>

His contributions to Sikhism are profound, including the founding of the Khalsa, a community of committed Sikhs, in 1699. This was a transformative moment, marking Sikhs not just by their faith but also by a distinct identity and way of life.
